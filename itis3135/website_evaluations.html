                <h3><a href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com/">The Big Ugly Website</a></h3>
                <p>A website dedicated to ugly design.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The contrast is pretty good in some areas, but it isn't consistent. There is little to no contrast in many areas of the site.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: There are way too many differing elements of this site. The colors are inconsistent. The fonts and images vary in size all over the page.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The images used in this site are offset in uneven ways. There are images that overlap one another.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Everything is bunched together with no real room for each element to be expressed genuinely.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="">YouTube</a></h3>
                <p>A video/music streaming website with high-level design properties.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The light and dark mode features both handle contrast well. The platform only displays the best content in terms of quality and aesthetic. The simplistic design utilizes black and white in many places to provide a clear experience.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: The subheadings of the page are all white letters with black backgrounds.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The grid that separates each element is clear. The videos have their own section, and the categories have their own section as well.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Everything on the page has room to breathe: the videos, the logo, the profile picture, the titles, etc.</li>
                </ul>
