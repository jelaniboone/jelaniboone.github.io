			<section id="aboutme">
				<h2>About Me:</h2>
				<p> My name is Jelani Boone and my hobby is writing songs that I can record in recording studios. I was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina
                    and I am currently 21 years old. This is my seventh semester here at UNC Charlotte, and I can't wait to graduate! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Information Technology with the ambitions of landing a tech job that allows me to work remotely. 
					I'm a family-oriented person and I enjoy to travel, so remote work would fare best for me. </p>
			</section>
			<section id="origin">
				<h2>When I Started:</h2>
				<p> I started to write songs as a young child, approximately age 10, and then when I graduated high school during quarantine, I began to put more serious effort
					into it. The pandemic allowed me to stay home and focus on keeping myself motivated amongst difficult and peculiar new times. 
					This is when I wrote and released my first single "Lilo" to all streaming platforms. This was a huge leap of faith for me at the time, and 
					I was overjoyed upon receiving positive feedback.

			<section id="dojo">
				<h2>My Dojo:</h2>
				<p> I usually enjoy cooking the most in my own home, however, I would not mind cooking anywhere else especially
                    if food is needed during a particualar moment outside my home along with the right food ingredients provided for me 
                    to cook with. One thing I will admit is the fact that I do cook my best when I am not watched and/or observed by another 
                    individual because there is less pressure put on my shoulders to cook with a great outcome. Cooking in my own home just 
                    gives me a different kind of enjoyment experience! I love playing music while cooking as well because it brings out 
                    the enthusiasm within my personality.

			<section id="theprocess">
				<h2>How I do my Hobby:</h2>
				<p> Initially I stared making my own healthy dishes by following online recipes. Mostly recipes on Youtube, Instagram, and 
					TikTok. I found these resources beneficial, helpful, and easy to follow because I am more of a person who learns best
					through visual representations and through explanations. Thus, it this helped me start. Most importantly, I grew up watching 
					my mother cook numerous recipes so I believe I was aware of a lot of meal preping expectations from her. Moreover, I always ultized
					her presence as an opportunity to learn from my mistakes as a beginner in cooking. Constantly listening to her constructive criticism
					helped me improve over time.

			<section id="purpose">
				<h2>Why I Started My Hobby:</h2>
				<p> I consider myself as an individual who strongly desires to achieve my fullest potential in all aspects of life; hence, I believe cooking helathy dishes progesses 
					me towards that goal mentally, emotionally, physically, and other important aspects of my life since what one consumes daily has an essentail impact on one's overall well-being. 
					Thus, this is my motivation to cook healthy dishes on a regualr basis.
