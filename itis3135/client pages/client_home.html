            <p style="color:aliceblue; font-size: medium; text-align: center;">
                The Association of Black Entrepreneurs and Creators is designed to create a psychologically safe space for Black/African-American, minority, and other college students of color to network and share different forms of creative expression, work on personal development, and create lifelong friendships built around entrepreneurial practice. There will be at least two meetings per month with a mixture of general body/discussion meetings and social meetings. Our general body/discussion meetings give members the opportunity to learn about topics relevant to entrepreneurship and their creative talents (i.e., music composition, visual arts, graphic design and application development) through presentations, workshops, and guest speakers. Our social meetings allow members to have fun and showcase their entrepreneurial and creative talents. This will be shown through exhibits, performances, idea pitch-events, and more.
